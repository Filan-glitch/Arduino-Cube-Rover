# Everday Bot

The Everyday Bot is a computer science project made in the university module 'Eingebette Systeme' at Hochschule Ruhr West. 
It is about an arduino driving robot controlled by a bluetooth controller with joystick and tilt control. The background is to create a project, that can be reproduced by a school class to get students interested in computer science.
